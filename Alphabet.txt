Official Eclipsian Alphabet | By Noctav & HAVICK

For capital letters, add an o to the end.
For vowel to vowel transitions when you are putting letters together (for example, e to a which is leem), say the vowel like it is by itself. (leem would be pronounced as leem instead of leh-ehm)

a: em (ehm)
b: pe (peh)
c: cor (core)
d: ra (rah)
e: le (leh)
f: de (deh)
g: ne (neh)
h: mul (mool)
i: te (teh)
j:
